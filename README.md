# Bookmarks
Displays vertical view of bookmarks in the top right corner.

To select a bookmark either click or focus on the page and press the key
of the the number to the left of the bookmark.
*Note: focusing the page is just tab in my browser (chrome on linux).*

All bookmarks in a folder can also be opened by middle clicking the folder,
presing spacebar before pressing the folder's key, or using the bookmark in
position 0 to open all for the current folder.

Right clicking on bookmarks displays a context menu with the option to delete
the bookmark.
